      <h3>Food History Of India - Reference Wiki</h3>
      <div class="history">
        <p>
          The history of Indian cuisine consists of cuisine of the Indian
          subcontinent, which is rich and diverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The diverse climate in the region, ranging from deep tropical to
          alpine, has also helped considerably broaden the set of ingredients
          readily available to the many schools of cookery in India.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many cases, food has become a marker of religious and social
          identity, with varying taboos and preferences (for instance, a segment
          of the Jain population consume no roots or subterranean vegetable; see
          Jain vegetarianism) which has also driven these groups to innovate
          extensively with the food sources that are deemed acceptable.
